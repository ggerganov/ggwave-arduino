# esp32-rx

This is a sample project for receiving audio data using [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) microcontroller.
The chip has a built-in 12-bit ADC which is used to process the analog audio from the external microphone module in real-time.
The received messages are displayed on the attached OLED display

## Setup

- NodeMCU-ESP32
- OLED SSD1306
- MAX9814 (also works with KY-037, KY-038 and WS Sound sensor)
